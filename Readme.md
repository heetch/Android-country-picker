    new CountryPickerDialog(mContext, new CountryPickerCallbacks() {
        @Override
        public void onCountrySelected(Country country, int flagResId) {
            // TODO handle callback

If you want to retrieve a flag res outside of the country picker dialog

the drawable have to be formatted as follow: `countryIsoCodeInLowerCase_flag`.
For example:
    `Utils.getMipmapResId(mContext, "fr_flag")`
